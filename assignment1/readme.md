Assignment 1
============
Assignment1 is about a simple image classification pipeline, including KNN, SVM/Softmax classifier, two-layer neural network,etc.<br>
Specificly, we need to accomplish these tasks based on CIFAR-10 datasets:<br>
   * k-Nearest Neighbor classifier<br>
   * Support Vector Machine<br>
   * Softmax classifier<br>
   * Two-Layer Neural Network<br>
   * Training based on Image Features like HOG and HSV<br>
